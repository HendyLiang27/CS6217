## Setup
VeriFast needs to be installed, the package can be found at https://github.com/verifast/verifast/releases.

To use VeriFast, there are three ways: dedicated IDE, VSCode extension or a command line tool. I have only tried the IDE and the VSCode extension and recommend the extension.

The extension is simple to install. Find the VeriFast extension in the VSCode marketplace and then point the path to wherever VeriFast is installed on your machine.

## Usage
When in a file, press Alt+Shift+V to verify the file. Since most of the annotations are not in proper annotated form, this will only verify a few basic methods. Adding the @ to the annotations will make them proper VeriFast annotations but they will fail the verification.
